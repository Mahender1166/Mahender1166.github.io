 <h4>C (programming language)</h4>
 <p>The C programming language is a computer programming language that was developed to do system programming for the operating system       UNIX and is an imperative programming language. C was developed in the early 1970s by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs.</p>
<h4>Loop control statements</h4>
<p> Loop control statements in C are used to perform looping operations until the given condition is true. Control comes out of the loop statements once condition becomes false. </p>
TYPES OF LOOP CONTROL STATEMENTS IN C:
There are 3 types of loop control statements in C language. They are,<br>
<p>
        1. for <br>
        2. while <br>
        3. dowhile <br>
        Syntax for each C loop control statements are<br>

<h4> EXAMPLE PROGRAM (FOR LOOP) IN C: </h4>
   <p> In for loop control statement, loop is executed until condition becomes false.<br>

</p>
OUTPUT: <br>
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 <br>

<h4> EXAMPLE PROGRAM (WHILE LOOP) IN C: </h4>
In while loop control statement, loop is executed until condition becomes false.<br>

OUTPUT:<br>
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 <br>

<h4> EXAMPLE PROGRAM (DO WHILE LOOP) IN C: </h4>
In do..while loop control statement, while loop is executed irrespective of the condition for first time. Then 2nd time onwards, loop is executed until condition becomes false.<br>

OUTPUT: <br>
- Value of i is 1 <br>
- Value of i is 2 <br>
- Value of i is 3 <br>
- Value of i is 4 <br>
